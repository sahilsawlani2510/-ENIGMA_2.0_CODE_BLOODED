## Packages
maplibre-gl | Core mapping library for 3D visualization without tokens
framer-motion | Essential for smooth UI animations, layout transitions, and the animated health score
lucide-react | Iconography for the dashboard

## Notes
- MapLibre GL is used directly with a React ref for maximum performance with 3D layers.
- The 3D city buildings are procedurally generated in the frontend around Navi Mumbai coordinates to ensure a rich visual experience without requiring premium Mapbox 3D tilesets.
- State is managed in React as requested, simulating a real-time digital twin.
