You are a senior geospatial software architect and full-stack engineer.

Build a production-ready web application called:

"Resilient City – Digital Twin for SDG 11"

Objective:
Create a 3D web-based digital twin simulator for a high-growth urban area (Navi Mumbai, India) that models:

• Urban heat island effect
• Green cover impact
• Flash flood simulation
• Real-time SDG 11 health score

Tech Stack Requirements:
- React (Vite)
- MapLibre GL JS (NO Mapbox token)
- Pure JavaScript
- No backend required (simulate data)
- Clean modular code
- Modern dashboard UI (dark theme)

Core Functional Requirements:

1. 3D City View
   - 3D extruded buildings
   - Tilted camera (pitch 60+)
   - Organic cluster-based city layout (NOT grid)
   - Buildings should remain fixed once generated
   - Heat values dynamically change
   - Flood state dynamically change

2. Green Cover Simulation
   - Slider (0% – 50%)
   - Higher green cover reduces heat intensity
   - Update building color accordingly

3. Flood Simulation
   - Toggle button
   - Flood turns affected buildings blue
   - Reduce health score when active

4. City Health Score (0–100)
   Score formula:
   - 40% green cover contribution
   - 30% inverse heat average
   - 30% flood penalty
   Should update live

5. UI Requirements
   - Left sidebar dashboard
   - Large animated health score number
   - Status indicator (Normal / Flood Emergency)
   - Modern glassmorphism/dark UI
   - Professional hackathon-ready look

6. Performance
   - City layout generated only once
   - Do NOT regenerate building positions on slider change
   - Update only properties (heat/flood)

7. Code Structure
   - Separate functions:
     generateBaseCity()
     updateCity()
     calculateHealthScore()
   - Clean comments
   - Maintainable structure

Deliver:
- Full App.jsx file
- All logic included
- No pseudo code
- Fully working implementation

Make it look impressive enough to win a hackathon demo.
